Indexing DublinCore metadata with Apache Solr
### Intro
DublinCore is, conversely speaking, a set of fields for describing document items. It has, as well, some specifications or rules applying to each field. Fields and their associated values can be in several formats; one of these is an XML spec, coming from de Open Archives Initiative.
This XML is particularly handly, as the OAI-ProtocolMetadataHarvest is a common way to access to records in open digital repositories.
### Data Source example
an DublinCore record in such XML format looks like:
<pre>
